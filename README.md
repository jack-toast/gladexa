### How it all works
![Main Diagram](https://github.com/jack-toast/gladexa/blob/master/images/overview%20diagram.png?raw=true)

#### The three main components:
- The Alexa skill / Echo itself
- The Lambda function that handles all of our processing and routing
- The S3 backend that holds all of our data

## Setting up the Alexa Skill
### 1. [Amazon Developer console](https://developer.amazon.com/) >> Sign In
### 2. Alexa Tab >> Alexa Skills Kit >> **Get Started**

### 3. Add a new skill ![Clickety Clack](https://github.com/jack-toast/gladexa/blob/master/images/addnewskill%20copy.PNG?raw=true)
### 4. Skill Information
  - Skill Type: Custom Interaction Model
  - Language: English (U.S. or U.K.) or German
  - Name: Whatever you want. This will show in the Alexa store thing if you publish the skill. I'm not publishing, so I named it for my own organization.
  - Invocation Name: I used "glados". Make sure it's something that the Alexa voice engine can understand phonetically
  - Global Fields: Ignore
  - Click *next*

### 5. Interaction Model

#### What it do?

The interaction model describes how our speech is parsed into a command that is sent to the Lambda function.

Let's take an example command and break it down.

*"Alexa, ask glados to tell me an interesting fact"*

Alexa | ask | glados | to | tell me an interesting fact
------|-----|--------|----|-----------------------------
Wake word | Linker | Invocation Name | Linker | Call a specific intent
